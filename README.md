## My process

This was a fairly stright forward affair. I initially had some trouble with the background image disappearing below the fold; changed the viewheight and this fixed it.

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

### Continued development

My CSS is hard-to-read spaghetti code; will need to find some way to get more organized in my stylesheet. Also want to use some version of BEM.
